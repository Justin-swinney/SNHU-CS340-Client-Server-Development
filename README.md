**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

- When creating programs I try to follow a standard naming conventions that many users will quickly understand, I also try and keep my code as modular as possible while still achieving the desired results I am looking for,
 Although I could have implemented 1 read function within my CRUD.py that allowed me to pass a deciding factor to determine if I needed to read many or read one I separated the methods for learning sake during this project.
 Creating modular code allows for clean and organized code that will allow for quick troubleshooting and easy modifications to be made without breaking or refactoring an entire class.
 This CRUD module could be used in the future to allow users to create new animals to enter into the database as well as remove them, additionally more methods could be added to achieve any requirements the client wished to have.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

- As a computer scientist I try and approach problems or requirements with an open mind but also an analytical mind. I think about the users while also thinking about the most logical approach to a solution. 
When approaching the requirements for project two I needed to consider UI/UX design as the user would be interacting with the components, I would be programming, this differed from the previous task as project one was primarily back-end service related and did not introduce any user interface. 
For future assignments I would like to utilize indexing and query optimizations to increase the speed of retrieval data. This is something I need to learn in more depth to gain a greater understanding and would be crucial when creating speedy data retrieval components. 

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

- Computer scientists can do a variety of tasks from software development and computer programming to data analysis and cyber security to teaching! Our world evolves around technology.
  Computer scientists play a vital role in maintaining and evolving the way we utilize technology.
  Given Grazioso Salvareâ€™s requirements the implementation of radio buttons as well as a search bar will help increase productivity by reducing time for users to have to manually search through a long list of data.
